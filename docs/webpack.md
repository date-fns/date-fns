## Removing unused languages from dynamic import

If a locale is imported dynamically, then all locales from date-fns are loaded by webpack into a bundle (~160kb) or split across the chunks. This prolongs the build process and increases the amount of space taken. However, it is possible to use webpack to trim down languages using [ContextReplacementPlugin].

Let's assume that we have a single point in which supported locales are present:

`config.js`:

```js
// `see date-fns/src/locale` for available locales
export const supportedLocales = ["en-US", "de", "pl", "it"];
```

We could also have a function that formats the date:

```js
const getLocale = (locale) => import(`date-fns/locale/${locale}/index.js`); // or require() if using CommonJS

const formatDate = (date, formatStyle, locale) => {
  return format(date, formatStyle, {
    locale: getLocale(locale),
  });
};
```

In order to exclude unused languages we can use webpacks [ContextReplacementPlugin].

`webpack.config.js`:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack'
import { supportedLocales } from './config.js'

export default const config = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(
      /^date-fns[/\\]locale$/,
      new RegExp(`\\.[/\\\\](${supportedLocales.join('|')})[/\\\\]index\\.js$`)
    )
  ]
}
```

This results in a language bundle of ~23kb .
