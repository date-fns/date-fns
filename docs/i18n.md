## Usage

**Important! Note that non-CommonJS packages (Bower, CDN)
don't support I18 yet.** Please [vote for the issue](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/232)
if you want to make it happen.

There are just a few functions that support I18n:

- [`format`](https://date-fns.org/docs/format)
- [`distanceInWords`](https://date-fns.org/docs/distanceInWords)
- [`distanceInWordsToNow`](https://date-fns.org/docs/distanceInWordsToNow)

To use a locale, you need to require it and then pass
as an option to a function:

```js
var distanceInWords = require('date-fns/distance_in_words')
// Require Esperanto locale
var eoLocale = require('date-fns/locale/eo')

var result = distanceInWords(
  new Date(2016, 7, 1),
  {locale: eoLocale} // Pass the locale as an option
)
//=> 'pli ol 1 jaro'
```

It might seem complicated to require and pass locales as options,
but unlike Moment.js which bloats your build with all the locales
by default date-fns forces developer to manually require locales when needed.
To make API simple, we encourage you to write tiny wrappers and use those
instead of original functions:

```js
// app/_lib/format.js

var format = require('date-fns/format')

var locales = {
  en: require('date-fns/locale/en'),
  eo: require('date-fns/locale/eo'),
  ru: require('date-fns/locale/ru')
}

module.exports = function (date, formatStr) {
  return format(date, formatStr, {
    locale: locales[window.__localeId__] // or global.__localeId__
  })
}

// Later:

var format = require('app/lib/format')

window.__localeId__ = 'en'
format(friday13, 'dddd D')
//=> 'Friday 13'

window.__localeId__ = 'eo'
format(friday13, 'dddd D')
//=> 'vendredo 13'
```

## Supported Languages

date-fns currently supports:

1. [English](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/en)
   (`en`; it's the built-in language and doesn't require any setup)
2. [Russian](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/ru) (`ru`)
3. [Esperanto](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/eo) (`eo`)
4. [Chinese Simplified](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/zh_cn)
   (`zh_cn`; kudos to Changyu [@KingMario](https://github.com/KingMario) Geng)
5. [German](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/de)
   (`de`; kudos to Thomas [@DeMuu](https://github.com/DeMuu) Eilmsteiner)
6. [Japanese](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/ja)
   (`ja`; kudos to Thomas [@DeMuu](https://github.com/DeMuu) Eilmsteiner)

More is coming, help is welcome!

## Adding New Language

At the moment there is no definitive guide, so if you feel brave enough,
use this quick guide:

- First of all, [create an issue](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/new?title=XXX%20language%20support&labels[]=I18n)
  so you won't overlap with others.
- Use [English locale](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/en)
  as the basis and then incrementally adjust the tests and the code.
- If you have questions or need guidance, left a comment in the issue.

Thank you for your support!
