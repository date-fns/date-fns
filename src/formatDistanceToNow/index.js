 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `distanceInWordsToNow ` to `formatDistanceToNow`
 *   to make its name consistent with `format` and `formatRelative`.
 *
 *   ```javascript
 *   // Before v2.0.0
 *
 *   distanceInWordsToNow(new Date(2014, 6, 2), { addSuffix: true })
 *   //=> 'in 6 months'
 *
 *   // v2.0.0 onward
 *
 *   formatDistanceToNow(new Date(2014, 6, 2), { addSuffix: true })
 *   //=> 'in 6 months'
 *   ```
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the given date
 * @param {Object} [options] - the object with options
 * @param {Boolean} [options.includeSeconds=false] - distances less than a minute are more detailed
 * @param {Boolean} [options.addSuffix=false] - result specifies if now is earlier or later than the passed date
 * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}
 * @returns {String} the distance in words
 * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required
 * @throws {RangeError} `date` must not be Invalid Date
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `formatDistance` property
 *
 * @example
 * // If today is 1 January 2015, what is the distance to 2 July 2014?
 * var result = formatDistanceToNow(
 *   new Date(2014, 6, 2)
 * )
 * //=> '6 months'
 *
 * @example
 * // If now is 1 January 2015 00:00:00,
 * // what is the distance to 1 January 2015 00:00:15, including seconds?
 * var result = formatDistanceToNow(
 *   new Date(2015, 0, 1, 0, 0, 15),
 *   {includeSeconds: true}
 * )
 * //=> 'less than 20 seconds'
 *
 * @example
 * // If today is 1 January 2015,
 * // what is the distance to 1 January 2016, with a suffix?
 * var result = formatDistanceToNow(
 *   new Date(2016, 0, 1),
 *   {addSuffix: true}
 * )
 * //=> 'in about 1 year'
 *
 * @example
 * // If today is 1 January 2015,
 * // what is the distance to 1 August 2016 in Esperanto?
 * var eoLocale = require('date-fns/locale/eo')
 * var result = formatDistanceToNow(
 *   new Date(2016, 7, 1),
 *   {locale: eoLocale}
 * )
 * //=> 'pli ol 1 jaro'
