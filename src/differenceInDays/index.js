/**
 * @name differenceInDays
 * @category Day Helpers
 * @summary Get the number of full days between the given dates.
 *
 * @description
 * Get the number of full day periods between two dates. Fractional days are
 * truncated towards zero.
 *
 * One "full day" is the distance between a local time in one day to the same
 * local time on the next or previous day. A full day can sometimes be less than
 * or more than 24 hours if a daylight savings change happens between two dates.
 *
 * To ignore DST and only measure exact 24-hour periods, use this instead:
 * `Math.floor(differenceInHours(dateLeft, dateRight)/24)|0`.
 *
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} dateLeft - the later date
 * @param {Date|Number} dateRight - the earlier date
 * @returns {Number} the number of full days according to the local timezone
 * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required
 *
 * @example
 * // How many full days are between
 * // 2 July 2011 23:00:00 and 2 July 2012 00:00:00?
 * var result = differenceInDays(
 *   new Date(2012, 6, 2, 0, 0),
 *   new Date(2011, 6, 2, 23, 0)
 * )
 * //=> 365
 * // How many full days are between
 * // 2 July 2011 23:59:00 and 3 July 2011 00:01:00?
 * var result = differenceInDays(
 *   new Date(2011, 6, 3, 0, 1),
 *   new Date(2011, 6, 2, 23, 59)
 * )
 * //=> 0
 * // How many full days are between
 * // 1 March 2020 0:00 and 1 June 2020 0:00 ?
 * // Note: because local time is used, the
 * // result will always be 92 days, even in
 * // time zones where DST starts and the
 * // period has only 92*24-1 hours.
 * var result = differenceInDays(
 *   new Date(2020, 5, 1),
 *   new Date(2020, 2, 1)
 * )
//=> 92
