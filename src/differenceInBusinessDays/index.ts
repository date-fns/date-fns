/**
 * @name differenceInBusinessDays
 * @category Day Helpers
 * @summary Get the number of business days between the given dates.
 *
 * @description
 * Get the number of business day periods between the given dates.
 * Business days being days that aren't in the weekend.
 * Like `differenceInCalendarDays`, the function removes the times from
 * the dates before calculating the difference.
 *
 * @typeParam DateType - The `Date` type, the function operates on. Gets inferred from passed arguments. Allows to use extensions like [`UTCDate`](https://github.com/date-fns/utc).
 *
 * @param dateLeft - The later date (excluded)
 * @param dateRight - The earlier date (included)
 *
 * @returns The number of business days
 *
 * @example
 * // How many business days are between
 * // 10 January 2014 and 20 July 2014?
 * const result = differenceInBusinessDays(
 *   new Date(2014, 6, 20),
 *   new Date(2014, 0, 10)
 * )
 * //=> 136
 *
 * // How many business days are between
 * // 30 November 2021 and 1 November 2021?
 * const result = differenceInBusinessDays(
 *   new Date(2021, 10, 30),
 *   new Date(2021, 10, 1)
 * )
 * //=> 21
 *
 * // How many business days are between
 * // 1 November 2021 and 1 December 2021?
 * const result = differenceInBusinessDays(
 *   new Date(2021, 10, 1),
 *   new Date(2021, 11, 1)
 * )
 * //=> -22
 *
 * // How many business days are between
 * // 1 November 2021 and 1 November 2021 ?
 * const result = differenceInBusinessDays(
 *   new Date(2021, 10, 1),
 *   new Date(2021, 10, 1)
 * )
 * //=> 0
