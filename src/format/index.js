/**
 * @name format
 * @category Common Helpers
 * @summary Format the date.
 *
 * @description
 * Return the formatted date string in the given format. The result may vary by locale.
 *
 * The characters wrapped between two single quotes characters (') are escaped.
 * Two single quotes in a row, whether inside or outside a quoted sequence, represent a 'real' single quote.
 * (see the last example)
 *
 * Format of the string is based on Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 * https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
 * with a few additions (see note 7 below the table).

 * Notes:
 * 1. "Formatting" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale
 *    are the same as "stand-alone" units, but are different in some languages.
 *    "Formatting" units are declined according to the rules of the language
 *    in the context of a date. "Stand-alone" units are always nominative singular:
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`
 *
 * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by
 *    the single quote characters (see below).
 *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)
 *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually
 *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units
 *    are marked with "2" in the last column of the table.
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).
 *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`
 *
 * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.
 *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.
 *
 * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:
 *
 *    | Year | `y` | `u` |
 *    |------|-----|-----|
 *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |
 *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |
 *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |
 *
 *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,
 *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:
 *
 *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |
 *    |------|------|------|
 *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |
 *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |
 *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |
 *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |
 *
 *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),
 *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`
 *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}
 *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).
 *
 * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,
 *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.
 *
 * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 *    - `i`: ISO day of week
 *    - `I`: ISO week of year
 *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year
 *    - `t`: seconds timestamp
 *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp
 *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier
 *    - `P`: long localized date
 *    - `p`: long localized time
 *
 * @param {Date|String|Number} date - the original date
 * @param {String} format - the string of tokens
 * @param {Options} [options] - the object with options. See [Options]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Options}
 * @param {0|1|2} [options.additionalDigits=2] - passed to `toDate`. See [toDate]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/toDate}
 * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)
 * @param {Number} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is
 * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}
 * @returns {String} the formatted date string
 * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.additionalDigits` must be 0, 1 or 2
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `localize` property
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `formatLong` property
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7
 *
 * @example
 * // Represent 11 February 2014 in middle-endian format:
 * var result = format(
 *   new Date(2014, 1, 11),
 *   'MM/dd/yyyy'
 * )
 * //=> '02/11/2014'
 *
 * @example
 * // Represent 2 July 2014 in Esperanto:
 * import { eoLocale } from 'date-fns/locale/eo'
 * var result = format(
 *   new Date(2014, 6, 2),
 *   "do 'de' MMMM yyyy",
 *   {locale: eoLocale}
 * )
 * //=> '2-a de julio 2014'
 *
 * @example
 * // Escape string by single quote characters:
 * var result = format(
 *   new Date(2014, 6, 2, 15),
 *   "h 'o''clock'"
 * )
 * //=> "3 o'clock"
