 * @description
 * Add the specified number of months to the given date.
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * @param date - The date to be changed
 * @param amount - The amount of months to be added. Positive decimals will be rounded using `Math.floor`, decimals less than zero will be rounded using `Math.ceil`.
 * @returns The new date with the months added
 *
 * @example
 * // Add 5 months to 1 September 2014:
 * const result = addMonths(new Date(2014, 8, 1), 5)
 * //=> Sun Feb 01 2015 00:00:00

  // The JS Date object supports date math by accepting out-of-bounds values for
  // month, day, etc. For example, new Date(2020, 1, 0) returns 31 Dec 2019 and
  // new Date(2020, 13, 1) returns 1 Feb 2021.  This is *almost* the behavior we
  // want except that dates will wrap around the end of a month, meaning that
  // new Date(2020, 13, 31) will return 3 Mar 2021 not 28 Feb 2021 as desired. So
  // we'll default to the end of the desired month by adding 1 to the desired
  // month and using a date of 0 to back up one day to the end of the desired
  // month.
  const endOfDesiredMonth = new Date(date.getTime())

    // If we're already at the end of the month, then this is the correct date
    // and we're done.
    return endOfDesiredMonth

    // Otherwise, we now know that setting the original day-of-month value won't
    // cause an overflow, so set the desired day-of-month. Note that we can't
    // just set the date of `endOfDesiredMonth` because that object may have had
    // its time changed in the unusual case where where a DST transition was on
    // the last day of the month and its local time was in the hour skipped or
    // repeated next to a DST transition.  So we use `date` instead which is
    // guaranteed to still have the original time.
