 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `endOfISOYear` to `endOfISOWeekYear`.
 *   "ISO week year" is short for [ISO week-numbering year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).
 *   This change makes the name consistent with
 *   locale-dependent week-numbering year helpers, e.g., `addWeekYears`.
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date
 * @returns {Date} the end of an ISO week-numbering year
 * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required
 *
 * @example
 * // The end of an ISO week-numbering year for 2 July 2005:
 * var result = endOfISOWeekYear(new Date(2005, 6, 2))
 * //=> Sun Jan 01 2006 23:59:59.999
