 * @description
 * Get the number of full ISO week-numbering years between the given dates.
 *
 * ISO week-numbering year: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `differenceInISOYears` to `differenceInISOWeekYears`.
 *   "ISO week year" is short for [ISO week-numbering year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).
 *   This change makes the name consistent with
 *   locale-dependent week-numbering year helpers, e.g., `addWeekYears`.
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} dateLeft - the later date
 * @param {Date|Number} dateRight - the earlier date
 * @returns {Number} the number of full ISO week-numbering years
 * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required
 *
 * @example
 * // How many full ISO week-numbering years are between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2012?
 * var result = differenceInISOWeekYears(
 *   new Date(2012, 0, 1),
 *   new Date(2010, 0, 1)
 * )
 * //=> 1
