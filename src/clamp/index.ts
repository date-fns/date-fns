/**
 * @name clamp
 * @category Interval Helpers
 * @summary Return a date bounded by the start and the end of the given interval
 *
 * @description
 * Clamps a date to the lower bound with the start of the interval and the upper
 * bound with the end of the interval.
 *
 * - When the date is less than the start of the interval, the start is returned.
 * - When the date is greater than the end of the interval, the end is returned.
 * - Otherwise the date is returned.
 *
 * @typeParam DateType - The `Date` type, the function operates on. Gets inferred from passed arguments. Allows to use extensions like [`UTCDate`](https://github.com/date-fns/utc).
 *
 * @param date - The date to be bounded
 * @param interval - The interval to bound to
 *
 * @returns The date bounded by the start and the end of the interval
 *
 * @example
 * // What is Mar, 21, 2021 bounded to an interval starting at Mar, 22, 2021 and ending at Apr, 01, 2021
 * const result = clamp(new Date(2021, 2, 21), {
 *   start: new Date(2021, 2, 22),
 *   end: new Date(2021, 3, 1),
 * })
 * //=> Mon Mar 22 2021 00:00:00
