 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `distanceInWords ` to `formatDistance`
 *   to make its name consistent with `format` and `formatRelative`.
 *
 * - The order of arguments is swapped to make the function
 *   consistent with `differenceIn...` functions.
 *
 *   ```javascript
 *   // Before v2.0.0
 *
 *   distanceInWords(
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 11, 32, 0),
 *     { addSuffix: true }
 *   ) //=> 'in about 1 hour'
 *
 *   // v2.0.0 onward
 *
 *   formatDistance(
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 11, 32, 0),
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
 *     { addSuffix: true }
 *   ) //=> 'in about 1 hour'
 *   ```
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the date
 * @param {Date|Number} baseDate - the date to compare with
 * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.
 * @param {Boolean} [options.includeSeconds=false] - distances less than a minute are more detailed
 * @param {Boolean} [options.addSuffix=false] - result indicates if the second date is earlier or later than the first
 * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}
 * @returns {String} the distance in words
 * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `formatDistance` property
 *
 * @example
 * // What is the distance between 2 July 2014 and 1 January 2015?
 * var result = formatDistance(new Date(2014, 6, 2), new Date(2015, 0, 1))
 * //=> '6 months'
 *
 * @example
 * // What is the distance between 1 January 2015 00:00:15
 * // and 1 January 2015 00:00:00, including seconds?
 * var result = formatDistance(
 *   new Date(2015, 0, 1, 0, 0, 15),
 *   new Date(2015, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
 *   { includeSeconds: true }
 * )
 * //=> 'less than 20 seconds'
 *
 * @example
 * // What is the distance from 1 January 2016
 * // to 1 January 2015, with a suffix?
 * var result = formatDistance(new Date(2015, 0, 1), new Date(2016, 0, 1), {
 *   addSuffix: true
 * })
 * //=> 'about 1 year ago'
 *
 * @example
 * // What is the distance between 1 August 2016 and 1 January 2015 in Esperanto?
 * import { eoLocale } from 'date-fns/locale/eo'
 * var result = formatDistance(new Date(2016, 7, 1), new Date(2015, 0, 1), {
 *   locale: eoLocale
 * })
 * //=> 'pli ol 1 jaro'
