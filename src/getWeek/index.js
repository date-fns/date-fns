 * @name getWeek
 * @category Week Helpers
 * @summary Get the local week index of the given date.
 *
 * @description
 * Get the local week index of the given date.
 * The exact calculation depends on the values of
 * `options.weekStartsOn` (which is the index of the first day of the week)
 * and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (which is the day of January, which is always in
 * the first week of the week-numbering year)
 *
 * Week numbering: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Week_numbering

 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the given date
 * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.
 * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)
 * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year
 * @returns {Number} the week
 * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6
 * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7
 *
 * @example
 * // Which week of the local week numbering year is 2 January 2005 with default options?
 * var result = getISOWeek(new Date(2005, 0, 2))
 * //=> 2
 *
 * // Which week of the local week numbering year is 2 January 2005,
 * // if Monday is the first day of the week,
 * // and the first week of the year always contains 4 January?
 * var result = getISOWeek(new Date(2005, 0, 2), {
 *   weekStartsOn: 1,
 *   firstWeekContainsDate: 4
 * })
 * //=> 53
