 *
 * ISO week-numbering year: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `getISOYear` to `getISOWeekYear`.
 *   "ISO week year" is short for [ISO week-numbering year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).
 *   This change makes the name consistent with
 *   locale-dependent week-numbering year helpers, e.g., `getWeekYear`.
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the given date
 * @returns {Number} the ISO week-numbering year
 * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required
 *
 * @example
 * // Which ISO-week numbering year is 2 January 2005?
 * var result = getISOWeekYear(new Date(2005, 0, 2))
 * //=> 2004
