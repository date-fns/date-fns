## How to Help?

Help is always welcome. There are areas where you can help:

- The core functionality (performance improvements, bug fixes,
  new features, etc.).

- Documentation ([markdown documents](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/search?l=markdown),
  inline JSDoc comments).

- Test suite & development environment improvements.

- The [website](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org).

If you see a gap, but don't have time, experience, or you just need help
with the library, don't hesitate to [shoot an issue](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/new).

The date-fns functionality is comprehensive and covers most of the use cases,
however it doesn't have extended time zone support. Please leave a comment
to the [Extended time zones support issue](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/180)
if you are interested in the functionality or want to help with development.

If you are interested in Elm/ClojureScript/etc. wrappers,
please [file an issue](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/new).

## Contribution Guidelines

Due to the modular nature of date-fns, it's more than open to new features.
However, when a new function duplicates the existing functionality, native API
or causes significant build size increase, a PR might be rejected or
the author can be asked to move the code to a new or another package.

Please follow the main contributing rules, to maintain date-fns' top quality:

- Follow style guides:

  - [Lint the code](#lint-the-code).

  - [Use EditorConfig](#use-editorconfig).

- Write tests.

- [Write documentation](#documentation).

- [Write good commit messages].

- Add an entry to Unreleased section in [CHANGELOG].

- Squash related commits before a PR merge.

- Don't change the library version.

## Code Style Guide

### Lint the Code

The project follows [JavaScript Standard Style]. To lint the code, run:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn run lint
```

[JavaScript Standard Style]: http://standardjs.com/

### Use EditorConfig

The project uses [EditorConfig] to define basic coding style guides.
Please install a plugin for your editor of choice or manually enforce
the rules listed in [.editorconfig].

[EditorConfig]: http://editorconfig.org
[.editorconfig]: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org/blob/master/.editorconfig

## Documentation

### JSDoc

[JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org) is used for the code documentation. Along with
standard JSDoc tags, date-fns uses `@category` tag that allows
to group functions.

[jsdoc-parse](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-parse) is used to generate
[documentation JSON](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs.json)
consumed by [date-fns.org](https://date-fns.org/docs).
